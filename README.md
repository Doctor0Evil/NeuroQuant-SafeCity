# NeuroQuant-SafeCity

Quantized human-machine safety framework ensuring secure, authenticated neural–infrastructure interaction for smart-city systems.

### Features
- Layered quantization framework (intent → actuation)
- Orthogonal frequency/time isolation for neural signals
- AES-256 authenticated transmission
- Real-time safety and anomaly monitoring
- Mechanical fail-safe integration for flood-gate controls

> Each step in the digital signal path is quantized, verified, and securely routed — preventing cross-talk or unauthorized control.
